# Set static values

space_in_a_car = 4.0
drivers = 30

# Calculate the numbers of cars not being driven
cars_not_driven = cars - drivers

# Calculate the number of cars driven which is equal to the number of drivers
cars_driven = drivers

# Calculate the carpool capacity by multiplying the space in each car by the
# total numbers of cars being driven

# Calculate the average passengers per car by dividing the total passengers
# by the number of cars being driven
